# README.md for GRU Factor Excavating Module

## Overview
This GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) Factor Excavating Module is a Python script designed for analyzing and processing time series data. It utilizes advanced neural network techniques to extract meaningful factors from complex datasets.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn

## Installation
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib torch scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To use the GRU Factor Excavating Module, run the script from your command line:

```bash
python V2_GRU_model.py
```

Ensure your data is in the appropriate format as expected by the script.

1. **Importing Libraries and Modules:**
   - The script begins by importing various libraries and modules.
   - Libraries like `numpy` and `pandas` are used for data manipulation and mathematical operations.
   - `matplotlib` is used for data visualization.
   - `torch` and related modules from PyTorch signify the use of neural networks, specifically a GRU model.
   - The script also imports custom modules like `DataFeeder`, `DataAPI`, and `FactorBase`, which are likely related to data handling and factor extraction.

2. **Data Handling and Preprocessing:**
   - The presence of `DataFeeder`, `DataAPI`, and data preprocessing libraries suggests steps for loading, preprocessing, and possibly transforming data to feed into the GRU model.

3. **GRU Model Setup:**
   - The use of PyTorch (importing `torch` and `torch.nn`) indicates the setup and definition of a GRU model, which involves defining the model architecture and parameters.

4. **Data Interface Instantiation:**
   - The script initializes instances of `DataFeeder` and `DataAPI`, which are likely custom classes or modules for data retrieval and management.

5. **Data Loading and Feature Engineering:**
   - The script loads a dataset, presumably stock trading data, and performs data filtering and feature engineering.
   - Operations include filtering data by date, selecting relevant columns, and calculating new features like 'vwap' (Volume Weighted Average Price).
   - It also involves grouping data by stock code and creating new features like 'return_5', which might be a form of return calculation based on the stock prices.

6. **Data Processing Function:**
   - A function `process_stock` is defined to process individual stock sequences. It appears to select certain data points based on conditions and may be used for preparing the dataset for model training.

7. **Data Loader and Index Setup:**
   - Variables for `train_loader`, `train_index_list`, `test_loader`, and `test_index_list` are initialized. These are likely used for storing training and testing datasets and their respective indices, a common practice in preparing data for machine learning models.

8. **Data Splitting and Processing Loop:**
   - The script iterates through dates, splitting data into training and testing sets based on a predefined date. This is a typical approach in time series analysis, where data is sequentially split to maintain the temporal order.
   - It retrieves return data for the current date and categorizes it as training or testing data.

9. **Feature Engineering and Data Aggregation:**
   - For each date in a defined window, the script loads minute-level stock data and performs feature engineering, such as calculating the 'vwap'.
   - It also applies certain filters and adjustments to the data, potentially to clean it or to align it with the requirements of the model.
   - The script concatenates data from multiple dates to create a comprehensive dataset for each window.

10. **Feature Processing and Normalization:**
    - The script processes and normalizes features such as stock prices and volumes, which is a critical step for effective neural network training.

11. **Parallel Processing and Batch Preparation:**
    - Utilizing `multiprocessing`, the script processes stocks in parallel. This likely enhances performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
    - The results are gathered into batches, which are then divided into training and testing sets.

12. **Model Training Environment Setup:**
    - The script sets up the device for training (CPU or GPU), indicating the use of PyTorch's device management for efficient computation.

13. **GRU Model Training:**
    - The script includes code for training the GRU model, although the model's architecture isn't explicitly shown in the analyzed parts. This training process involves adjusting the model's parameters based on the training data.

14. **Model Evaluation and Prediction:**
    - The model is evaluated and used to make predictions on both the training and testing datasets. These predictions are then saved, presumably for further analysis.

15. **Visualization of Training and Validation Metrics:**
    - The script plots training and validation loss and accuracy, providing a visual understanding of the model's performance over time.

16. **Saving Model and Output:**
    - Finally, the script saves the trained model's state and outputs the predictions to files.
